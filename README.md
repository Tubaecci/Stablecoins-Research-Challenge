# Stablecoin Comparison

| Stablecoin | **Backing Mechanism** | **Sustainability** | **Decentralization** |
|------------|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **USDT (Tether)** | Fiat-backed. Collateral consists mainly of U.S. Treasury bills, cash, and other short-term assets. Redeemable 1:1 for USD via Tether Ltd. | Very liquid and widely adopted (>65% of stablecoin market cap). Risks include regulatory scrutiny, transparency concerns, and centralized custody. | Fully centralized. Issuance, redemption, and reserves are controlled by Tether Holdings. |
| **DAI (MakerDAO)** | Overcollateralized with crypto assets (ETH, wstETH, USDC, etc.). Smart contracts enforce collateral ratios and liquidations. | Historically resilient (e.g., March 2020 “Black Thursday”). But reliance on USDC weakens independence. Generates sustainable revenue via fees and liquidations. | Semi-decentralized. Governed by MakerDAO token holders, but USDC reliance introduces centralization risk. |
| **FRAX (Frax Finance)** | Hybrid model: part collateralized (USDC, USDT, ETH), part algorithmic (mint/burn + AMO mechanisms). | Held up post-UST collapse. Sustainability depends on liquidity and market confidence. Less battle-tested than USDT/DAI. | More decentralized than USDT, governed by Frax DAO. Still partly centralized due to USDC reliance and governance concentration. |
